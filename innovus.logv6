[12/02 15:50:38    129s] Clock Tree Violations Report
[12/02 15:50:38    129s] ============================
[12/02 15:50:38    129s] 
[12/02 15:50:38    129s] The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[12/02 15:50:38    129s] A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[12/02 15:50:38    129s] Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

[12/02 16:22:29    838s] The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
