Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree clk at (278.200,1864.400), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clk which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 1.020pF.


Primary reporting skew group is skew_group clk/constraint with 4601 clock sinks.

**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
